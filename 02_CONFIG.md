## Configuration

ZicBox is fully customizable using the `./config.ui` file.

> To get styling for .ui extension in VScode, use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and type `Change Language Mode`. Then select `Configure File Association for '.ui'...` and select `CoffeScript`.

Those `.ui` files are simple configuration files. It is base on [DustScript](https://github.com/apiel/dustscript) mainly using `KEY:VALUE` to set the configuration and providing some extra feature on top of it, like variable, if statement and while loop. However, using those scription features are not mandatory and the UI can be fully configured without it.

The user interface is composed of views and components. A view is composed of multiple components. A component is for example a button or a rotary encoder. Each of the UI components are external shared library that can be loaded dynamically when the application start.
