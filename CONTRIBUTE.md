## Install Cross-Compilation Tools

To simplify development, install a cross-compiler toolchain for ARM on your dev machine. In order to do this, let's use zicOs a custom OS create for zicBox, based on buildroot: https://github.com/apiel/zicOs

Install alongside to your zicBox project:
```
- dev folder
-- zicBox
-- zicOs
```
