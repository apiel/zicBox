One button could be to assign stuff to a value, like a CV modulation, or assign a Pot...

Buttons:
- trigger
- note repeat
- assign params to CV or knob ?
- shift
- mute
- play


Maybe best would be to just give the possibility to assign the action of the button... Like we could assign CV or the 2 knobs...
